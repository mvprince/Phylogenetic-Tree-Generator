This program converts evolutionary similarity data into an evolutionary tree. The input data is in Phylip format, with each sequence having a similarity index comparing it to every other sequence.

The most similar groups are repeatedly merged using an agglomerative clustering algorithm. Each 'merge' represents a branch in the evolutionary tree.

The output data takes the form of a Newick tree. Each set of parentheses represents a 'merge,' and the numbers represent the evolutionary distance from the last branch. This machine-readable format is easily converted into a graphical evolutionary tree.
